# Content Creator to Audience Chat App

This project is a real-time chat application designed specifically for **content creators** to engage directly with their audience. It solves the common issue of traditional broadcast platforms—like Instagram Channels—where creators can send messages but can't receive individual replies in an organized way.

## ✨ Key Features

### One-to-Many Chat Model
- Content creators can see messages from all users.
- Each user only sees messages from the content creator.
- This maintains a personal-feeling interaction without overwhelming the creator.

### Frontend
- Built using **React** with **Vite** for lightning-fast development.
- Modular components and dynamic routing for a scalable, maintainable codebase.

### Backend
- **Firebase Authentication** handles secure sign-in/sign-up workflows.
- **Cloud Firestore** enables real-time message storage and syncing across users.

## 📁 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite  
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Storage, & Firestore)
